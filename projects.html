									<h4>Translation between SDSS and MaNGA Data</h4>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects-images/manga_vae.png" alt="" /></span>
										Building off previous work done by Finn, this project was a proof of concept of the utilization of the structured latent space of Variational Autoencoders and VQ-VAEs to 
										translate between two types of spectral data. MaNGA data is considered to be a more informative representation of galactic spectra, but is more difficult to obtain. This work 
										aims to get an approximation of that data given a much more readily available data found in SDSS sampling. My role in this project was to aid in the creation of 
										the autoencoders themselves.

									<h4>Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - 05/2024</h4>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects-images/Introduction to RL.png" alt="" /></span>
										An informal lecture series trying to demistify reinforcement learning, providing the basic understandings and 
										providing boilerplate templates for tabular Q-learning in python.   

										You can find the slides and accompanying colab below:

									<h4>Improving VAE Generative Capabilities with Kernel Density Estimation - 03/2024</h4>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects-images/KDE-Estimation Graph.png" alt="" /></span>
										This was a project done in SENG 474, taught my Alex Thomo. It analyzes the generative capabilities a variational autoencoder has by sampling its latent space, 
										which is traditionally done by taking samples from gaussian distributions. I demonstrated that KDE would provide a better approximation of the generative capabilities.

										<br>

										This project was awarded 100%.

									<h4>Optimal Power Distribution for a Cycling Individual Time Trial Using Reinforcement Learning - 11/2023</h4>

									<p>
										This was a group project done with 3 other members for Math 377, taught by Treffor Bazett. We used DQN to model the optimal power distribution for an agent
										going through a race, given some constraints. <br>

										This project was awarded a 98%.

									<h4>Introduction to Variational Auto Encoders - ?/2023</h4>

									<p>
										This was my pre-requisite project that helped me really understand what machine learning was. A much better entry point for a beginner. I took
										this on in my second term of second year, to help me prepare for a more research based project with astronomy data. 
									</p>

								<hr />
									<h4>Tetris + DQN - ?/2022</h4>

									<p>
										My first ever reinforcement learning project, in the spring of my first year. DQN was implemented with many tears involved. I had no 
										business starting my machine learning journey here. It shows as well. This is awful.
