							<p>Here are some of the papers I've written and have been shared in some capacity.

								<h4>Mechanistic Interpretability of Reinforcement Learning Agents</h4>

								<p>
									Inspired by a hackathon UVicAI helped organize, DeepRacer, a few members of the club came up with the idea that the education of machine learning should be done 
									in the form of learning the isolated components, as to make the field less daunting. I came up with three different aspects of making machine learning work.
									<ul>
										<li>Data Processing</li>
										<li>Neural Network Creation</li>
										<li>Data Visualization</li>
										<li>Semantics (Training loop, different kinds of losses, etc.)</li>
									</ul>
									Meant for use by the club, but I also took the liberty to learn some cool architectures. You'll find implementations of Bayesian Neural Networks, Deep Dream, and a 
									california housing model in here.

								<h4>Introduction to Reinforcement Learning - 05/2024</h4>

								<p>
									One of my first workshops as UVicAI president. An informal lecture series trying to demistify reinforcement learning, providing the basic understandings and 
									providing boilerplate templates for tabular Q-learning in python.   
								</p>

							<hr />
								<h4>Improving VAE Generative Capabilities with Kernel Density Estimation - 03/2024</h4>

								<p>
									This was a project done in SENG 474, taught my Alex Thomo. It analyzes the generative capabilities a variational autoencoder has by sampling its latent space, 
									which is traditionally done by taking samples from gaussian distributions. I demonstrated that KDE would provide a better approximation of the generative capabilities.

									<br>

									This project was awarded 100%.

								<h4>Optimal Power Distribution for a Cycling Individual Time Trial Using Reinforcement Learning - 11/2023</h4>

								<p>
									This was a group project done with 3 other members for Math 377, taught by Treffor Bazett. We used DQN to model the optimal power distribution for an agent
									going through a race, given some constraints. <br>

									This project was awarded a 98%.

								<h4>Introduction to Variational Auto Encoders - ?/2023</h4>

								<p>
									This was my pre-requisite project that helped me really understand what machine learning was. A much better entry point for a beginner. I took
									this on in my second term of second year, to help me prepare for a more research based project with astronomy data. 
								</p>

							<hr />
								<h4>Tetris + DQN - ?/2022</h4>

								<p>
									My first ever reinforcement learning project, in the spring of my first year. DQN was implemented with many tears involved. I had no 
									business starting my machine learning journey here. It shows as well. This is awful.
